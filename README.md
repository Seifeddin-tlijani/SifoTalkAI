# Sifoitalkia - Spring Boot HTMX Application with Spring Integration and Spring AI

## Overview

**Sifoitalkia** is a web application built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Integration**, **Spring AI**, and **HTMX** for the user interface. Spring Boot provides the foundation for the backend, Spring Integration manages messaging flows and routing, Spring AI integrates artificial intelligence functionalities, and HTMX allows for dynamic UI updates without full page reloads.

## Introduction
As a Spring Boot enthusiast, I am passionate about building robust and scalable applications that leverage the power of the Spring ecosystem. Sifoitalkia represents my exploration into the realm of modern web application development, where I integrate advanced technologies such as  Open Api Key , Spring AI alongside HTMX for a seamless user experience.


### Project Architecture
- **Spring Boot**: The core framework that powers the backend of the application.
- **Spring AI**: Enhances the application with intelligent features, enabling advanced processing and analysis.
- **HTMX**: Enables dynamic interactions and updates on the frontend without requiring a full page reload.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Using HTMX to provide seamless user interactions.
- **Messaging and Routing**: Leverages Spring Integration for efficient communication between components.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes Spring AI for advanced data processing and analysis capabilities.


## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- A database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seifeddin-tlijani/SifoTalkAI.git
   cd SifoTalkAI
   ```

2. **Configure your application**:
   - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database connection details and other configurations.

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8084`.

## Usage

- **Interact with the API**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test the RESTful API endpoints.
- **Explore the UI**: Navigate through the application to experience the dynamic features powered by HTMX.

## Testing Your Application

To test your application, consider the following scenarios:

1. **Application Startup**: Ensure the application starts without errors.
2. **API Endpoints**: Verify that all API endpoints return the expected responses and status codes.
4. **HTMX Interactions**: Check that all HTMX features work correctly for dynamic UI updates.
